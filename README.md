Getting started wit Git
I am trying and working on understading the process of Git. 
So far I am finding it very interesting.
I have to be a pro Git user in near future.
I  really have to focus on understanding of  all of the basic features of Git.
So I  can answer all of the Questions during the interview.
Thank you.
